# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Doofens

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A face detection system that allows users to choose one of the following tools:
- wearing mask
- analyze emotions
- detect drowsiness

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

After receiving the user's selection for one of the above tools, the system will open a webcam to analyze the user's face and give the related output. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

There's no other related classes.
I will execute this project in Python (if this is considered to be related to 1051).

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

I complete this project on my own.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

The system will automatically open a webcam to capture the user's face, no matter which option they choose.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I can do all the necessary research and readings to implement into my work. A better outcome is when the system can successfully function up to 85% out of what I have expected. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope the system would function successfully with any tool without false detections, hard coding or program errors.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I have to do more research about OpenCV and computer vision techniques in order to finish this project. As far as I know, the system requires a sequential CNN model and inbuilt Keras library so I also need to learn about them. After finishing all the necessary readings, I will divide the whole work into three main sections which are the main functions of the project, start working with each one effectively, and in the end gathering everything into a complete one. Since there is no collaboration, I will first do the research readings and then implement them into my own work from scratch.
