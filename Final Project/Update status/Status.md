#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have completed the face detection tool to deter whether users are wearing proper masks or reporting facial emotions

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I'm still working on the detecting drowsiness part since this task requires a lot of research and using OpenCV professionally

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

For the first time ever, I felt how painful being stuck at working on projects was haha. Sometimes I had to debug everything and work from scratch all over again.
